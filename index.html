                    <p> Dave Threlkeld is a web developer studying at the University of Texas at Austin. His
                        professional
                        background is predominately project management in the last decade and various technical
                        positions in the decade before that. Starting out as a jazz major at University of North Texas,
                        he became an accomplished sound engineer and worked through the ranks, eventually becoming a
                        talent buyer presenting concerts in the Northwest United States. Parallel to the professional
                        side he volunteered as an EMT/Firefighter in college and the hazmat training became a full time
                        profession during the BP oil spill, leading a team of HAZWOPERS in the worst affected areas.</p>

                    <p>After the oil spill he moved back to Texas to work on a career in management and joined a local
                        volunteer fire department, rising to his current rank of Assistant Chief. He spent the last five
                        years working as a very hands-on project manager in small manufacturing and technical
                        construction trades. The Covid pandemic
                        illustrated the volatility of non-tech contract projects and he enrolled at UT to study web
                        development. He remains very involved in the community music scene, playing in Austin's Minor
                        Mishap Marching Band.</p>
